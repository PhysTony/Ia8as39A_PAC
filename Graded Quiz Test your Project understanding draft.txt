1. We can transform or normalize our dataset during the setup environment process?
True
Apart from these we can perform a lot of data wrangling tasks while setting up the environment.

2. While comparing models we can blacklist some models we don’t want to compare?
False
Sometimes based on our experience, understanding of models or business needs. we can blacklist
certain models.

3. What is the default fold count when we create a model?
10
PyCaret have 10 folds by default.

4. We have to give initial parameters to our tuning model as a starting point?
False
That’s the wonder of PyCaret that you don’t have to specify anything at all.

5. Stacking is a technique of?
Ensemble learning that combines multiple models via a meta model
Stacking is ensemble based but uses a meta model at front

6. What ensemble methods do?
*C: It uses multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance
It is quite a popular method.

7. Confusion matrix is not a way of visualizing classification performance?
False
Confusion Matrix is commonly used to describe the performance of a classification model
